# MDSD-P-Udvidelse
I have create a State machine that shift state based on the temperture or wind or a 3 attribute 
that should be definded when bulid the state machine. There hasn't been made Documentation in the code futher more there hasn't been implemented 
extensive input/build checking.

The state mashine is inspired by Ulriks Code. 

It is posible to run the code without IDE on Windows by running the .exe file found here: 
..\MDSD-P Udvidelse\MDSD-P\bin\Debug\MDSD-P.exe
